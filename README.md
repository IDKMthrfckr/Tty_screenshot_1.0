# Tty_screenshot_1.0
A short, only partially functional script that takes a screenshot in tty using fbcat

To use this script, you will need to first install fbcat: https://github.com/jwilk/fbcat

This doesn't even really save you that much time, instead of "fbcat > /home/username/Pictures/fbcat/screenshot.ppm" 
You use (depending on directory) "sh ~/bin/screenshot.sh".

Honestly pretty useless, took me way more time than it should have.
